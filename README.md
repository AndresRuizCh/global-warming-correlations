# Global Warming Correlations

Use data from different sources to generate correlation plots of different variables. For example, to study the correlation between Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Global Warming it generates:

- A choropleth map representing the emissions by country:
![CO2_Map](Figures/Map\_CO2 Emitted \(kT\))
- A time graph showing the evolution of the emissions and the linear regression prediction:
![CO2_Plot](Figures/Plot\_CO2 Emitted \(kT\))
- An scatter plot with the correlation between both series:
![CO2_Corr](Figures/Corr\_Average Temperature \(Celsius\)\_CO2 Emitted \(kT\))

The data sources are the following:
- World Bank Dataset: [](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)
- Temperature Dataset: [](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)
- Choropleth's Shapefile: [](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector)
- Countries ISO Codes: [](https://datahub.io/core/country-list)
